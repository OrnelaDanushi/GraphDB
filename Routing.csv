This allows a remote, man-in-the-middle attacker to eavesdrop on a Telnet session to obtain credentials or other sensitive information and to modify traffic exchanged between a client and server.

6.4,"Medium","10.0.111.102","SSL Certificate Cannot Be Trusted","The server's X.509 certificate does not have a signature from a known public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below which certificates cannot be trusted. 

First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority. 

Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the certificate's 'notAfter' dates. 

Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn't match the certificate's information, or could not be verified.  Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that could not be verified are the result of the certificate's issuer using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not recognize. 

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host."
